        <h2>Welcome to this experiment created to investigate implicit associations in academia</h2>

        <p>	  <b>Data Privacy:</b> Data exchanged uses the same secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS). This provides strong security for data transfer. Also, IP addresses are NOT recorded. If you want to check by yourself, you can have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/romainligneul/black-academia" target="_blank" >Github repository</a> showing all the files and scripts on the server. While this test is mostly an educational tool, we might make the anonymous data collected and analysis scripts publicly available. </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Important disclaimer</strong>: In reporting to you results of any IAT test that you take, the program will mention possible interpretations that have a basis in research done with these tests. However, the citizens who have contributed to this site, make no claim for the validity of these suggested interpretations. If you are unprepared to encounter interpretations that you might find objectionable, please do not proceed further. You may prefer to examine general information about the IAT on <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/iatdetails.html" target="_blank" >Project Implicit</a> webpages before deciding whether or not to proceed. This app uses Node.js, Express.js, JsPsych, Heroku and MongoDB as main external tools/services. It owes also a lot to Project Implicit regarding visual stimuli, task structure and data analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Who are we and what will we do with the data?</strong> We are group of neuroscientists attempting to gather data on implicit biases in academia.  This experiment is mostly designed to raise awareness about a societal problem. However, if enough data is collected, we may report them on our Github page. If you want to get in touch with us, feel free to contact romain.ligneul@gmail.com</p>

        <h3>I am aware of the possibility of encountering interpretations of my IAT test performance with which I may not agree. Knowing this, I wish to proceed. </h3>
