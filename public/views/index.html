        <p>	  <b>Data Privacy:</b> Data exchanged uses the same secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS) that banks use to securely transfer credit card information. This provides strong security for data transfer. Moreover, IP addresses are NOT recorded by this site. If you want to check by yourself, you can have a look at the Github repository. While this test is mostly an educational tool, I might make the anonymous data collected publicly available, without references to the institution or country in which you might have taken the test (since there is no IP collection, this information will not even appear in the database).</p>
        <p><strong>Important disclaimer</strong>: In reporting to you results of any IAT test that you take, the program will mention possible interpretations that have a basis in research done with these tests. However, these Universities, the individual researcher who has contributed to this site, make no claim for the validity of these suggested interpretations. If you are unprepared to encounter interpretations that you might find objectionable, please do not proceed further. You may prefer to examine <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/iatdetails.html" target="new" >general information about the IAT</a> before deciding whether or not to proceed.</p>
